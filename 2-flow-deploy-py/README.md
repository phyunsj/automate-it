Revisted [Node-RED flow deployment with Ansible](https://github.com/phyunsj/automate-it/blob/master/README.md). The small scale of nodes can be managed by python alone. See [node_red_flow_deploy.py](https://github.com/phyunsj/automate-it/blob/master/2-flow-deploy-py/node_red_flow_deploy.py). 

#### What is [Pexpect](https://github.com/pexpect/pexpect)?

**Pexpect** is a pure Python module for spawning child applications; controlling them; and responding to expected patterns in their output. Pexpect works like Don Libesâ€™ Expect. Pexpect allows your script to spawn a child application and control it as if a human were typing commands. **Pexpect** can be used for automating interactive applications such as ssh, ftp, passwd, telnet, etc. ..._from [Pexpect Doc](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)_
